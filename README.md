Welcome to the Hello Shoes Pvt. Ltd repository! This project aims to develop an enterprise-level shoe shop management system using Spring Framework, specializing in Spring Boot and MySQL. The system provides comprehensive functionalities for managing sales, supplierEntities, customers, employees, inventoryEntity, and an admin panel for summarizing sales data.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Streamline business processes and replace legacy practices with modern solutions to improve operational efficiency and customerEntity service.
- Provide a userEntity-friendly interface for both employees and customers, enhancing the overall userEntity experience.
- Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
- Utilize industry best practices and design patterns to build a maintainable and extensible system architecture.

## System Architecture
The system follows a multi-layered architecture comprising the following layers:
1. **API Layer**: Responsible for handling incoming requests and routing them to appropriate controllers. Implements RESTful APIs for communication with the client-side.
2. **Business Object (BO) Layer**: Implements business logic and orchestrates interactions between different components. Manages transactions, validations, and business rules.
3. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data persistence and interacts with the database. Utilizes Spring Data JPA for seamless integration with MySQL.

## Business Process
The proposed system aims to streamline various business processes of Hello Shoes Pvt. Ltd, including:
- Sales Processing: Facilitate sales transactions, refunds, and payment processing. Maintain transaction history and generate invoices for customers.
- Inventory Management: Track stock levels, update inventoryEntity data based on sales, and send alerts for low-stock items. Implement barcode scanning and RFID tagging for efficient inventoryEntity management.
- Customer Management: Record customerEntity details, including loyalty program membership, purchase history, and birthdays. Send personalized greetings and promotional offers to loyal customers.
- Employee Management: Manage employeeEntity data, roles, and access levels across branches. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and audit trails for accountability.
- Admin Panel Functionality: Provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring sales performance, inventoryEntity status, and customerEntity engagement metrics. Enable administrators to configure system settings and generate custom reports.

## System Requirements
The system must meet the following requirements:
- Utilize MySQL as the preferred relational database management system, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
- Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization, including features such as password hashing, session management, and CSRF protection.
- Handle validation and error handling on both the client and server sides to ensure data consistency and prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Incorporate logging and monitoring mechanisms to track system activities, diagnose errors, and optimize performance.
- Support responsive web design principles to ensure compatibility across devices and browsers, enhancing accessibility for users.

## Tech Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:
- **Front End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap
- **Back End**: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Other Tools**: Maven, Git, Postman (for API testing)
